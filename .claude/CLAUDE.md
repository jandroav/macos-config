# Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to projectplan.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Use context7 mcp server to get documentation and information about the project.
8. Use sequentialthinking mcp server for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process.
9. Use the memory mcp server for persistent memory using a local knowledge graph. This lets Claude remember information about the user across chats.
10. Finally, add a review section to the projectplan.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
