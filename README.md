# :green_apple: My macOS configs

## :grey_exclamation: Overview

This repository includes my configuration files for `oh-my-zsh`, as well as a list of my current `macOS` applications, `brew` packages, and `vscode` extensions. The configuration is tailored for the `macOS` built-in terminal emulator, using `zsh` as the default shell and is enhanced with the powerful `oh-my-zsh` framework.

## :nail_care: Theme

I am using the [Powerlevel10k - Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/powerlevel10k) theme for a sleek, modern look with informative prompts.

## :eyes: Why Stick with Built-in macOS Apps?

## Firefox browser

I chose Firefox for my DevOps work because it offers unique features that align perfectly with the demands of my workflow. One standout feature is its `multi-container` capability. This allows me to isolate contexts into specific containers, making it easy to manage multiple AWS accounts simultaneously. For example, I can have several `AWS` accounts open in the same browser window, each in its own tab, without cross-contamination of cookies or sessions.

Additionally, Firefox enables better personalization through support for plain `CSS` customization. This means I can tweak the browserâ€™s appearance to match my preferences or create custom styles that improve productivity, especially when dealing with dashboards or text-heavy interfaces. These features combine to make Firefox an invaluable tool for my DevOps tasks, offering both functional flexibility and a personalized experience.
